            I have always been fascinated by ancient unexplained structures like
            the great pyramid of Giza or Angkor Wat. Alternative archaeologists
            like Graham Hancock, Randall Carlson, and Robert Schoch continually
            bring to light interesting points that intrigues the public and
            inspires new research. Mainstream academia tends to ignore or deny
            controversial theories such as a world wide flood or heavy rainfall
            in the Sphinx enclosure, despite growing evidence that these events
            occurred.

            What this site aims to do is give the curious a platform to talk
            without discrimination. There is no dogma or agenda that needs to be
            catered to. Just people sharing ideas about the origins of some of
            these amazing locations.
